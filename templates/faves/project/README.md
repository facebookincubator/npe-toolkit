# Project Files

This directory will be autogenerated for most Toolkit apps during initial development,
and there will be a command to generate a version to check in if an app wants to override
any values.

For simplicity in the initial OSS release we are checking in the code instead of generating.

*Note: For those familiar with `expo prebuild`, that is the inspiration for this flow.**
