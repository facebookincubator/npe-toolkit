# Terms of Service

One of the steps you need to take to release your app is to have terms of

Users who sign up with a given set of terms can't easily have them changed, and
the TOS can impact your ability to email or SMS your customers, display ads,

Early applications commonly link to the TOS from the login screen and from
Settings (this is the default in Toolit sample apps), and you can find services
that will help generate your Terms of Service - here's the
