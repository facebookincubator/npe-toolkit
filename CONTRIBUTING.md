# Contributing to the NPE Toolkit
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

## Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. [Integration tests](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/facebookincubator/npe-toolkit) should automatically run when you create your PR.

## Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is
clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

Meta has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe
disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process
outlined on that page and do not file a public issue.

## Coding Style
We have eslint rules set up that should be used to autoformat files before submission. This works best if you have your IDE set up to autoformat on save
