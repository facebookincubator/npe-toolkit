# Abacus (v0.0.1) shell
*Expo 46 | React Native 18*

Toolkit Shells are preconfigured JavaScript (and soon iOS and Android) directories.

Shells allow you to start development writing only TypeScript files and not having to manage `package.json` or multiple configuration files. To ensure runtime compatibility, shells are versioned along with Expo and React Native.
